# FINAL PROJECT MOBILE APP

## Api Technology

I used Directus for the API, as it is a technology that I'm used to work with and that I know perfectly. I deployed the backend with Docker on GCP. I used Postgres as a database.

## Libraries used

- Coil Compose for image loading
- Navigation Compose for navigation
- Datastore for the JWT Storage
- Retrofit + GSON + OKHTTP for the Api Client

## Decision made:
I focused on building a fully working app rather than having a good UI but a product that doesn't work.
That's why it looks bad but it works great. Rather than using a fake API, I designed a real production-like backend,
with an admin panel, role-based access and secure authentication.
